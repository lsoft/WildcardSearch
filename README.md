# WildcardSearch

Visual Studio searching by wildcards

![Modified window](example.png)

Red border means the button works in wildcard mode. Regular border means something went wrong and this VSIX is not loaded or experienced a trouble.

Please NOTE: this extension support floating `Find And Replace` window mode ONLY! If this window is docked, I can't intercept `Alt+A` **keyboard** command for an unknown reason. In the floating mode this problem does not exists.
